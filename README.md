Nice — this is a great architecture for an e-commerce platform. Below I’ll give a complete, ready-to-use **Django microservice** for the **Product Service** (Django + Django REST Framework). It includes:

* models (products, images, categories, shop snapshot),
* serializers,
* viewsets / endpoints for **customers** and **shop owners**,
* simple auth/permission integration assuming an external Auth microservice (JWT),
* a location/radius search (Haversine) to return products from nearest shops,
* a placeholder for **image-search** integration (call your image search / recognition microservice),
* notes on syncing shop data and production considerations.

I’ll keep the code runnable and explain each endpoint and how it’s used by both websites.

# 1 — Assumptions & design notes

* You already have `auth` and `shop` microservices.
* `auth` issues JWT tokens. Tokens contain a `role` claim (`customer` or `shop_owner`) and if `shop_owner`, a `shop_id` or user can manage multiple shops; adapt as needed.
* Product service stores product records and a **snapshot** of shop location (`shop_id`, `shop_name`, `lat`, `lng`). This avoids having to query the shop service for every location search (sync via events or periodic sync API).
* Image search will be implemented by calling an external image-search microservice (or embedding your model). In the code I show a placeholder function `call_image_search_service`.
* For nearest-shop searches we use the Haversine formula in Django ORM annotate (works with floats — no GeoDjango dependency).

# 8 — urls.py (products/urls.py and project urls)

`products/urls.py`:

```python
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from .views import ProductViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'products', ProductViewSet, basename='product')

urlpatterns = router.urls
```

`product_service/urls.py`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/v1/', include('products.urls')),
]
```

---

# 9 — Authentication integration

Two approaches:

1. **JWT validation locally:** Use `djangorestframework-simplejwt` with the same secret/public key as auth service to decode tokens in this microservice. Token claims will contain `role`, `shop_id`, etc. Then `request.user` or `request.auth` carries those claims.

2. **Introspect tokens with auth service:** On each request call auth service's `/token/verify` or `/userinfo` to validate and obtain roles. This adds network latency but centralizes auth.

**Example (simple):** set DRF `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES` to a custom `JWTAuthentication` that decodes token and attaches a simple `user` object with `role` and `shop_id` claims.

---

# 10 — How each endpoint will be used (customer vs shop owner website)

I'll list endpoints and explain expected clients & auth:

## Public / Customer endpoints

(All customers can use these — no special role required.)

1. `GET /api/v1/products/`

   * Purpose: browse all available products (global listing).
   * Query params: `page`, `ordering=price`, `search` (via `?search=shirt`).
   * Response: paginated products with images and shop snapshot.

2. `GET /api/v1/products/{id}/`

   * Purpose: product details page. Shows product attributes and merchant (shop snapshot). Customers can click `shop_lat/lng` to view the shop on map.

3. `GET /api/v1/products/search/?q=...&lat=...&lng=...&radius_km=...`

   * Purpose: **search by text + location radius**. Use when customer searches text or image — returns products from shops within the radius sorted by distance.
   * Example: `?q=red%20sofa&lat=19.0760&lng=72.8777&radius_km=10`

4. `POST /api/v1/products/image-search/`

   * Purpose: customer uploads image to search visually similar products.
   * Flow: frontend uploads image -> product service sends image to vision microservice -> receives matched product ids or tags -> returns product list.
   * Output: list of matching products (product ids + shop snapshot). Use to show nearest matches.

## Shop owner endpoints (require shop\_owner role / JWT)

1. `POST /api/v1/products/`

   * Purpose: create a product for the shop of the logged-in owner.
   * Behavior: server reads `shop_id` from token claims and sets `shop_id`,`shop_name`,`shop_lat`,`shop_lng`. Owners cannot create products for other shops.

2. `PUT/PATCH /api/v1/products/{id}/`

   * Purpose: update product (only allowed for products that belong to the shop owner). Object-level permission checks compare product.shop\_id to shop\_id in the token.

3. `DELETE /api/v1/products/{id}/`

   * Purpose: remove product (soft-delete recommended, here we can set `available=False`).

4. `POST /api/v1/products/{id}/images/` (you can add a nested view for images)

   * Purpose: upload product images (only owner).

5. Bulk endpoints (optional): `POST /api/v1/products/bulk_create/` to create many products (CSV/JSON) — helpful for onboarding shop owners.

---

# 11 — Syncing shop data (important)

Because shop location matters for radius search, keep a shop snapshot stored in Product rows. To keep snapshots fresh:

* Option A: **Event-driven** — when shop updates location/name, Shop microservice emits an event (Kafka/RabbitMQ) to Product service; Product service updates all relevant product rows' `shop_lat` and `shop_lng`.
* Option B: **On-demand** — store only `shop_id` and when search occurs, query Shop service for locations for shops in candidate set (adds network calls).
* Option C: **Periodic sync** — cron job fetches shop list and updates product snapshots.

Event-driven is recommended for near-real-time consistency.

---

# 12 — Image search integration (high-level)

* Option A: Run a feature extractor (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP) to get image embeddings for product images; store them in a vector DB (FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone). Query with customer image to return top K product ids.
* Option B: If you already have an ML microservice, call it: `POST /vision/search` with the image file → returns list of product ids → query products table for these ids and return product+shop snapshot sorted by proximity.

In the provided code `call_image_search_service` is a placeholder; implement actual HTTP call or internal python call.

---

# 13 — Example usage flows

### Customer flow — text search then view nearest shops:

1. Customer types "leather chair".
2. Frontend calls: `GET /api/v1/products/search/?q=leather%20chair&lat=19.07&lng=72.87&radius_km=10`
3. Product service returns a list of products with `distance_km` per product. Frontend shows product cards and map pins using `shop_lat/shop_lng`. Clicking pin opens the shop page on your frontend which can call Shop microservice for full shop details.

### Customer flow — image search:

1. Customer uploads product image in frontend.
2. Frontend `POST /api/v1/products/image-search/` with the image file.
3. Product service calls vision microservice; receives product ids; returns product objects for nearest shops. Frontend displays matches and map pins.

### Shop owner flow — manage products:

1. Shop owner signs in using Auth service; obtains JWT (role `shop_owner`, `shop_id`).
2. Owner goes to dashboard, sends `POST /api/v1/products/` with product details and images. Product service reads `shop_id` from token and assigns ownership.
3. Owner can `PUT/PATCH` or `DELETE` their products. Object-level permission prevents editing others' products.

---

# 14 — Recommendations / production considerations

* Use vector DB for fast image similarity search (Milvus/FAISS/Pinecone).
* Use full-text search (Postgres `tsvector` or ElasticSearch) for better text search.
* Use Geo indexing (PostGIS) for efficient radius queries if you expect many shops/products.
* Soft delete instead of hard delete.
* Rate-limit image-search endpoint (expensive).
* Use event-driven sync for shop snapshots.
* CDN for images and S3-compatible storage (use `django-storages`).

# 15 — Quick Dockerfile (optional)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
CMD ["gunicorn", "product_service.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "--workers", "3"]
```

---

# 16 — Example curl requests

Create product (owner):

```bash
curl -X POST https://products.example.com/api/v1/products/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name":"Classic Leather Sofa",
    "description":"3-seater leather sofa",
    "price":"24999.00",
    "category": 3,
    "tags":["leather","sofa","livingroom"]
  }'
```

Search by text & location (customer):

```bash
curl "https://products.example.com/api/v1/products/search/?q=sofa&lat=19.0760&lng=72.8777&radius_km=10"
```

Image search:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://products.example.com/api/v1/products/image-search/" \
  -F "image=@/path/to/photo.jpg"
```

---

# 17 — What I didn't implement here (and quick next steps you might want)

* Full JWT decoding middleware — adapt to your auth tokens.
* Image-upload nested route for adding images to products (you can add a `ProductImageViewSet`).
* Vector DB and image-embedding pipeline.
* Robust Haversine in DB (for production use PostGIS instead of Python list convert).
* Tests, serializers for create with nested images.

---

If you want, I can:

* provide the full file contents in a GitHub-ready repo (models, views, settings).
* implement JWT authentication middleware that decodes your auth JWT structure (give me one sample token or token claims).
* add a `ProductImageViewSet` to handle image uploads and S3 integration.
* convert the radius search to use PostGIS for production scale.

Which of those should I generate next?
